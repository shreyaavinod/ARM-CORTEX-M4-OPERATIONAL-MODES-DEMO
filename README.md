## ARM CORTEX M4 OPERATIONAL MODES DEMO


âœ¨ Overview
This project demonstrates context switching between Thread Mode (normal code execution) and Handler Mode (interrupt service routine execution) on an STM32 microcontroller. It uses software-triggered interrupts via the NVIC STIR register to simulate hardware interrupts, providing a clear example of how Cortex-M cores handle interrupts.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Implements UART logging to visualize mode changes.

Shows manual interrupt triggering using the NVIC STIR register (0xE000EF00).

Explains Thread Mode â†’ Handler Mode â†’ Thread Mode transitions.

Uses RTC Wake-Up interrupt handler (RTC_WKUP_IRQHandler) as the ISR.

Fully based on STM32 HAL (STM32CubeIDE auto-generated skeleton).

ðŸ›  Hardware & Tools
Target MCU: STM32 Cortex-M4 (e.g., STM32F4xx)

IDE: STM32CubeIDE (or STM32CubeMX + GCC toolchain)

Debug/Flash: ST-Link/V2

Serial Monitor: Any terminal (115200 baud)

ðŸš€ How It Works
Initialization Phase

System clock and peripherals (GPIO, UART) are configured.

UART is used to print logs at 115200 baud.

Thread Mode Execution

Code in main() starts in Thread Mode:

c
Copy
Edit
printf("Instructions being executed in the THREAD MODE during main() execution.\r\n");
Trigger Interrupt via STIR

trigger_interrupts() manually enables interrupt #3 and writes to STIR:

c
Copy
Edit
uint32_t *pISER0 = (uint32_t*)0xE000E100; // NVIC ISER
uint32_t *pSTIR  = (uint32_t*)0xE000EF00; // NVIC STIR

*pISER0 |= (1 << 3); // Enable interrupt line 3
*pSTIR   = (3 & 0x1FF); // Trigger interrupt
Handler Mode Execution

CPU switches to Handler Mode and executes:

c
Copy
Edit
void RTC_WKUP_IRQHandler(void) {
    printf("In HANDLER MODE now when RTC_WKUP_IRQHandler called.\r\n");
}
Return to Thread Mode

After ISR completes, CPU returns to main execution flow.


ðŸ–¥ Expected Serial Output
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Instructions being executed in the THREAD MODE during main() execution.
Still in thread mode during trigger_interrupt() function call.
In HANDLER MODE now when RTC_WKUP_IRQHandler called.
Again returned to THREAD MODE after handler execution.
ðŸ§  Understanding NVIC Registers
ISER (Interrupt Set-Enable Register)

Address: 0xE000E100

Enables specific interrupt lines.

STIR (Software Trigger Interrupt Register)

Address: 0xE000EF00

Writing interrupt number (0â€“239) here triggers the ISR manually.
